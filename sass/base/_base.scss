/* The CSS code is a CSS reset or normalization code. It sets the margin and padding of all elements, as well as
the box-sizing property, to inherit the value from their parent element. This helps to ensure
consistent and predictable styling across different browsers and devices by removing any default
spacing or sizing that may be applied by the browser. */

/* The `html { font-size: 62.5%; }` code is setting the base font size for the HTML document to 62.5%.
This is often used as a technique to make it easier to calculate font sizes using the rem unit. By
setting the base font size to 62.5%, 1rem will be equal to 10 pixels (since 62.5% of the default
font size of 16 pixels is 10 pixels). This makes it simpler to work with font sizes in multiples of
10. */
